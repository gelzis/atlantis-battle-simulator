# Atlantis battle simulator

This repository contains battle simulator UI written in TypeScript.

## How does it work?

It uses modified version of the [Atlantis](https://github.com/Atlantis-PBEM/Atlantis) which is available 
[here](https://github.com/gelzis/Atlantis/tree/battle-simulator-json).
Modified version includes two features that are used by this UI:
- created `battle` cli command, that can read specificly structured JSON file and run the battle based on the file content, example of the json file [available here](https://atlantis.pekle.lv/example.json). example run `engine battle example.json`.
- created `exportdata` command, which exports two json files with all available current games items and combat related skills. `engine exportdata`, this is used to keep available skills/items up to date when game changes are made.

Engine executable is used on the backend and gets executed based on the json file generated by the UI written in TypeScript.

## How to run locally for development

To run locally:

```
npm i
npm run dev
npm run dev-server
``` 

Type checking isn't setup automatically (for performance reasons) for checking typescripts types you need to run

```
npm run dev-types
```

Linting can be done with

```
npm run lint
```
