# Atlantis battle simulator

This repository contains application of the battle simulator written in typescript.

## How does it work?

It uses modified version of the [Atlantis](https://github.com/artyomtrityak/Atlantis) which is available 
[here](https://github.com/gelzis/Atlantis/tree/battle-simulator-json).
Modified version includes two things that are used in by this UI:
- created `battle` cli command, that can read specific format of JSON file and run the battle, example of the json file [available here](https://atlantis.pekle.lv/example.json). example run `engine battle example.json`.
- created `exportdata` command, which exports two json files with all available current games items and combat related skills. `engine exportdata`

Engine executable is on the backend and gets executed based on the json file generated by the UI written in TypeScript.
